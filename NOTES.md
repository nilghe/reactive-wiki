# NOTES

I realise this is no where near complete and doesn't include what was asked. This is what I have done so far:

* Setup project with reactjs, altjs (flavour of FLUX), react-router, and gulp.js
* Display 10 random wiki entires on the front page
* Use can click into the wiki article and it displays the title and categories (which is retrieved by another API call)

Simple reason is I ran out of time (which is not an excuse and shows how terrible I am at budgeting my time). But, better to be honest than try and pass off something that is incomplete as something it isn't. 

Totally understand if you want to pass on this. No hard feelings. I didn't perform and well that's on me.
